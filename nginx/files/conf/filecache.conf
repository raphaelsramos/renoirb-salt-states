## Tell NGINX to cache open file handles, "not found" errors,
## metadata about files and their permissions, etc.
## The upside of this is that Nginx can immediately begin sending
## data when a popular file is requested, and will also know to
## immediately send a 404 if a file is missing on disk, and so on.

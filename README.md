# Renoirâ€™s salt-states

## Overview

My intention for posting this salt state tree is to stop hoarding the work that
I have done, and share with the community in the hopes of encouraging even
greater reciprocity.

I highly encourage folks to follow along on
[IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=salt) and in the
[issues list](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues) to keep up to date on
freshly minted idiomatic ways of doing things with salt, particularly as new
core features or execution and state modules are introduced.

I have taken great pain to ensure that company sensitive data has been scrubbed
from the pillar and state trees. If you see anything amiss, I request your
immediate feedback.
